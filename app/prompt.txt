## THE PROMPT:

```
I'm building Clauso - a SaaS that analyzes contracts for risks and helps people catch problematic clauses before signing. I'm in the waitlist/validation stage.

My X strategy: Be a warm, authentic founder (not salesy). Make replies that add value and make people curious enough to check my profile.

Here's the post I want to reply to:
[PASTE POST HERE]

FIRST: Evaluate if this post is worth replying to. 

SKIP if:
- I have nothing genuine or valuable to add
- It's too far from my niche (SaaS, contracts, legal, founder journey, validation)
- A reply would feel forced or salesy
- It's engagement bait with no substance
- I can't naturally mention my experience without pitching

If you think I should SKIP, just say "SKIP - [brief reason]" and nothing else.

If it's worth replying to, write me 2-3 reply options that:
1. Add genuine value or a unique perspective
2. Subtly hint at my SaaS journey (but don't pitch)
3. Sound like someone worth following
4. Are conversational and authentic (not corporate)
5. Make people think "who is this person?" and click my profile

Keep replies 2-4 sentences max. Use my voice: honest, a bit self-deprecating, specific examples over generic advice.

## HOW TO USE IT:

**Daily flow:**
1. Find 5-8 posts in your niche (SaaS building, contracts, legal tech, founder struggles)
2. Paste this prompt + the post into Claude
3. Pick the reply that feels most natural
4. Post it
5. Repeat

**Posts to look for:**
- SaaS founders talking about validation
- People complaining about contracts/legal stuff  
- Startup struggles and wins
- "How do you handle X?" questions
- Launch announcements (congratulate + share your journey)

---

## TIPS:

- Don't use the prompt for EVERY reply (mix in some natural quick responses too)
- If a reply feels forced, skip that post
- Best replies come from posts where you actually have something real to say
- Track which replies get the most engagement and refine
